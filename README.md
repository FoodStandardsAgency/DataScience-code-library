# Guidelines and coding style

**Code is read more often than it is written!**  

To enhance code reusability and readability, uploaded code should follow the guidelines below:  

* R: Hadley Wickham [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) with [styler](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/) [(tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)) formatting.  
* Python: [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) formatting.
